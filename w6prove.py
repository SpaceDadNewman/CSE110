revolver = ('You grab your trusty six shot Webley Revolver, get into the boat, and start down the mere. \n\
30 minutes into your journey a large mist envelops your boat, you\'d guess you were about half a kilometre from shore.\n\
You\'re pretty sure you could get back to the shore even without being able to see the dock or you could continues rowing \n\
Will you go BACK to the shore or will you PROCEED through the mist?: \n')

back = ('You start back towards where you believe the shore to be when suddenly a long dark neck emerges from the water towering over you. \n\
From what you can see the neck must be 5-8 metres long, and you can\'t even see the rest of the body.\n\
You immediately reach for your revolver, do you SHOOT the beast or WAIT to see what it does?: \n')

wait = ('The beast\'s neck snakes around your body, it\'s head directly infront of you, you\'re paralyzed with fear and the monster utters a single word; "chomp" \n\
it then chomps your head, killing you. \n')

shoot = ('You aim straight at the monster\'s head and unload all six shots into the beast. Every single bullet bounces off of \n\
it\'s skin only annoying it. The monster looks down at you, teeth baring down. Rather than attacking you, the beast immediately descends back into the water. \n\
You grab the paddle and frantically paddle back to shore when you feel something hit the bottom of the boat, flipping it over. The water is freezing but your adrenaline carries you through. \n\
Below the water line you see a faint light coming from what looks to be a cave do you contine back to SHORE or swim towards the LIGHT?: \n')

shore = ('You start back for shore but at this point you\'re a good 250 metres away and you\'re no John Arthur Jarvis Olympic Gold Medalist in the 1000 metre freestyle \n\
1900 Paris, France Olympics. You are struggling to get a breath when you feel a long slimy appendage wrap around your leg, it tugs you down towards the bottom, \n\
your lungs start filling full of water as you see the last bit of light you\'ll ever see, the monster shows it\'s face to you, the last face you\'ll ever see.\n')

light = ('You dive towards the light only hoping you can get past the beast without it spotting you. Upon succesfully getting to the cave there is an air pocket. \n\
You see what caused the light, 10,000,000 fireflies, and they lit up the cave which caused you to fall into a hypnotic sleep. Upon waking up you notice a rusted chest \n\
you open it to find a bejweled set of bag pipes. Luckily you are very similar in skill to the famous Fred Morrison who is a master on the pipes. \n\
you decide the only way you could possible survive it to play the pipes to the monster. After playing a beautiful rendition of Katy Perry\'s "Firework" \n\
you are able to befriend the beast and it takes you back to shore, letting you leave alive.\n')

proceed = ('You continue through the mist until you\'re at a point you believe to be the direct center of the lake, the deepest part. \n\
You drop your anchor and as soon as it\'s set properly the mist settles and you see it. 50 metres ahead of you is the great \n\
Lochness monster. You are about to reach for your pistol when you realize the beast is too far for any accurate or meaningful shot. \n\
You start rowing backwards frantically but the anchor won\'t budge, all you\'re doing is calling attention to yourself. \n\
The monster\'s head turns and you think there\'s only one thing you can do; JUMP into the water to avoid it\'s gaze, or let it SPOT you. \n')

jump = ('You jump into the water the water is too cold for you to survive, you\'re instantly paralyzed due to shock, you start to hyperventalate \n\
causing you to go into a state of hypoxia, everything around you starts to look different even the surrounding mountains start to look like spinach \n\
puffs, just like my Kronk used to make. Your legs stop working and you drift slowly downwards to the bottom of the loch, and you can only think of home \n\
and King George V as you slowly drift asleep.\n')

spot = ('The beast spots you and starts approaching you. As it gets closer and closer you decide there\'s only one way to get this beast, break your own arm \n\
which would confuse the beast. After breaking your arm in an undisclosed fashion, you succesfully confused the beast. It looks at you wondering what or why you \n\
just did that. It can only conclude that you\'ve lost your marbles and begins to back away as you are surely the apex predator. After asserting dominance you decide \n\
that with your broken arm you should just get away safely to return another time, you realize that maybe all of the riches in Scotland wasn\'t the actual treasure \n\
all along but it was the confidence (to break your own arm) you gained along the way. \n')

rock = ('You grab your favorite Pet Rock, Rocksanne, get into the boat, and start down the mere. \n\
30 minutes into your journey a large mist envelops your boat, you\'re glad you decided to bring your pet rock as it can protect you \n\
from fog, but there is also a chance that when using it, the rock can break and you\'d lose your one and only true friend. \n\
do you USE your rock or do you SAVE the rock\'s abilities for later?: \n')

use = ('You use the rock and instantly the mist disappears fortunately Rocksanne lives another day. Rocksanne starts humming at a loud volume, not only startling you \n\
but attracting the monster. You notice on the port side of your boat bubbles breaking the surface. All of the sudden the beast launches from the water attemping to grab Rocksanne \n\
you quickly pull it out of reach of the monster but the waves that the monster caused topples over your boat, causing it to capsize. As you hit the water Rocksanne starts to glow, a green glow \n\
illuminating the darkness. You decide there\'s only one of two things you can do, attempt to FLIP over the boat or use the light that Rocksanne is emmitting and FIGHT the beast. Or do you \n\
find the darkest corner of lake and HIDE there.')

hide = ('You panic and swim down to the deepest darkest part of the lake, to your luck there\'s a small air pocket just big enough for you to fit your head. \n\
you take a moment to gather yourself, you take several deep breaths calming yourself down, unfortunately you took too long and the monster is right on you, \n\
it grabs your leg, dragging you back to the center of the lake then launches you out of the lake, catapulting you over to the mountain range, you\'re suprised \n\
you survived the landing, but you get back up and vow to never go to Lochness again.')

flip = ('You start to flip the boat with little success, every attempt draining your energy. You give it one last try succesfully flipping the boat but the monster is too quick and mauls you.\n')

fight = ('The beast torpedoes towards you, bent on claiming Rocksanne for itself, and in a small way you know it will. You raise Rocksanne high, a single tear trickles down your cheek \n\
as you propel Rocksanne towards the temple of the Beast, but to your amazement Rocksanne splits in half sucking the beast in to it like a Pokeball, capturing it. You swim towards Rocksanne \n\
claiming the rock and the beast inside. You\'ve done it, you\'ve defeated Nessie.\n')

save = ('You decide to save Rocksanne afraid your favorite pet rock might come to an untimely demise, and continue through the mist. You believe you\'ve gotten to the middle of the lake and drop your anchor. \n\
As the anchor falls through the water it seems to hit the ground a little earlier than you\'d think. Almost immediantly after you noticed the anchor fall too quickly an enourmous creature breaches the water. \n\
It\'s already angry as what the anchor hit was the monster. You can do one of two things, ATTACK the creature head-on or use Rocksanne to magically BIND the beast.\n')

attack = ('You grab your oar and snap it in half creating a spear, you hurl it at the beast and it strikes it right between the ribs. you move towards the beast but the waves usher you away, you row him back \n\
across the lake, you get a drink. You have killed the creature, winning you all the riches in Scotland, but in the end, it wasn\'t the riches that were the true treasure, it was spending time with Rocksanne.\n')

bind = ('You will Rocksanne to magically bind the beast but in casting the spell Rocksanne tragically breaks. Your one and only friend has been shattered. This loss causes you to simply not want to continue \n\
you let the beast consume as life isn\'t even worth it anymore.\n')

easteregg = ('Suddenly Obi Wan falls down and says only two words; Hello There. He then pulls out of his belt, not his lightsaber but something even stronger...\n\n An uno reverse card. \n\
you start to be able to see through the beast. Unsure of what you\'re seeing, you then realize that the beast is simply fading from existence. You look at Obi Wan, a grin on his face.\n\
"you-you saved my life" you stammer, Obi Wan locks eyes with you then he fades away himself.')
